# TDTS06NetworkCourse
Sharing my labs done during TDTS06 course at Linköping University (HT2020).

## Lab 2
Very basic web proxy supporting multi-threading. The proxy intentionally alters certain texts and images. Only supporting HTTP.

### Configuration
Example of proxy configuration under firefox. The procedure is broadly similar for other browsers.
Go to preferences, go to the bottom of the General page, find "network options" and enter the following parameters:
```
Proxy HTTP: 127.0.0.1       Port: 8080
Proxy HTTPS: 127.0.0.1      Port: 8080
Hôte SOCKS: 127.0.0.1       Port: 8080
```

## Lab 4
Implementation of `RouterNode.java`. You will need the lab environnement to run the simulation. There is also a bash script useful for build and run the simulation.
