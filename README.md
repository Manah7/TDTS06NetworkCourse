# TDTS06NetworkCourse
Very basic web proxy done during TDTS06 course at Linköping University (HT2020). The proxy intentionally alters certain texts and images. Only supporting HTTP.

## Configuration
Example of proxy configuration under firefox. The procedure is broadly similar for other browsers.
Go to preferences, go to the bottom of the General page, find "network options" and enter the following parameters:
```
Proxy HTTP: 127.0.0.1       Port: 8080
Proxy HTTPS: 127.0.0.1      Port: 8080
